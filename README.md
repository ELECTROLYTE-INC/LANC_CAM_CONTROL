//Based on code of KOCH Martin - Created by DANEL Mario

//This librairie can control an LANC Camcorder (Like CANON G30 G40 G50 G70 XA30 XA40 X50 X70) with lot of command (Record, Zoom In (8modes) Zoom Out (8Modes), Focus In, Focus Far, Auto Focus, Power Off, Restart...etc...)

//You can change the LANC Pin with the :

//#define COMMAND_PIN 6
//#define LANC_PIN 7

//You can find lot of schematic to wiring your Arduino to your Camcorder with a transistor, diode, two resistor, some wiring and a 2.5mm jack.
